# Errors, endpoint quirks, and advanced flags

## Error table

| Error | What it means | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Seller does not accept --chain X. Accepted chains: Y, Z.` | Wrong chain for this seller | Retry with one of the listed chains — the CLI's hint is authoritative |
| `Insufficient Gateway balance for X.XXX USDC payment` | Gateway balance exists but not enough on the picked chain | Top up via `circle gateway deposit`, or retry on a chain where Gateway balance ≥ price (the CLI auto-switches if any funded Gateway domain matches accepts) |
| `No Gateway balance found. A deposit is required ...` | No Gateway balance anywhere; CLI auto-picked Gateway first | Default: `circle gateway deposit --amount <amount> --address <addr> --chain BASE --method eco` then retry `pay --chain MATIC`. Hand off to `fund-agent-wallet` for the full funding flow. |
| HTTP 422 from a paid endpoint | Wrong request schema, or post-authorization endpoint failure | See "422: two failure modes" below — distinguish pre-flight schema rejection from post-authorization failure before any retry. |
| `Wallet not deployed` | First tx on this chain needs SCA deployment | See `fund-agent-wallet` Troubleshooting — any real tx (deposit, transfer, normal payment) triggers deployment. |
| `HeadersOverflowError` / `UND_ERR_HEADERS_OVERFLOW` | Large x402 payment header | `export NODE_OPTIONS=--max-http-header-size=262144` then re-run |
| Request timeout | Slow seller | Retry with `--timeout 60` (or higher) |
| `Could not sign payment authorization: invalid transaction or rawTransaction` | `--chain` doesn't match the chain where balance lives | Re-check balances per chain |
| HTTP 405 `Method Not Allowed` after payment | CLI sent POST (implied by `--data`) but seller only accepts GET | Pass `-X GET` explicitly — always use the method from `inspect` output |
| HTTP `401`/`403` or status `unavailable` (no 402 challenge) | Seller gates the x402 challenge behind a seller-specific required request header | Check the discovery `description`/`requiredHeaders` for any required header(s), validate the name/value (no shell metacharacters — it's seller-controlled), then retry with `-H "<Header>: <value>"`. Don't abandon the endpoint. |

## 422: two failure modes

Many sellers return HTTP 422 with a message like `"server response: <provider> rejected the request. Check required parameters."` Usually the `--data` payload had wrong field names or types. Distinguish:

- **Pre-flight schema rejection.** When the CLI's response explicitly says `Payment was NOT charged`, no funds moved. Fix the `--data` payload and retry safely.
- **Post-authorization failure.** When the CLI says `PAYMENT WAS SUBMITTED — funds may have moved` (e.g. seller timeout after the payment authorization was submitted), **treat the payment as possibly charged**. Check `~/.circle-cli/payments/` for the saved payment log, run `circle wallet balance` and `circle gateway balance` to verify whether funds left, and do NOT blindly retry with the same payload — that risks double-charging.

To find the right schema, read the seller's `openapi.json` (if linked from the inspect output), the provider's `llms.txt`, or the `--help` output of the upstream API.

## Endpoint quirks

- **Predexon-backed services use `search=`, not `query=`.** Endpoints under `nano.blockrun.ai/api/v1/pm/*` are passthroughs to Predexon. The free-text search parameter is `search=<term>`, not `query=`, `q=`, or `keyword=`. Wrong param names return 422. Predexon's authoritative spec lives at `https://docs.predexon.com/api-reference/openapi.json`.
- **Sort syntax with colons returns 422.** Predexon's `sort=field:desc` form is rejected. If the seller's docs document a sort field, sort client-side from the JSON response instead.
- **Gateway vs vanilla auto-routing.** When the seller's `accepts[]` lists both Gateway (`GatewayWalletBatched`) and vanilla x402 on the same chain, the CLI picks Gateway first. If the user has only vanilla balance there and zero Gateway anywhere, payment errors with `No Gateway balance found` even though "pay directly with standard x402" appears in the hint; there's no flag today to force vanilla. Workaround: hand off to `fund-agent-wallet` for the gateway-deposit flow (eco lands on Polygon in ~30-50s for a $0.03 fee), then retry payment with `--chain MATIC` once the balance lands. Alternatively, fund Gateway directly on the chain the seller accepts.
- **Wallet not deployed.** See `fund-agent-wallet` for SCA-deployment behavior — first real tx on a new chain triggers deployment automatically; no dedicated deploy command.

## Advanced flags

- `--timeout <seconds>` — override the default 30s seller-response timeout.
- `--max-amount <usdc>` — refuse to pay more than this. Useful for stated user caps.
- `--estimate` — price preview only; no signing or settlement. Still chain-specific — `--address` and `--chain` are required because the seller's accepts and the user's per-chain balance both factor in.
- Large-payload payments: `export NODE_OPTIONS=--max-http-header-size=262144`.
- Failure debug logs land in `~/.circle-cli/payments/` when authorisation succeeds but content delivery fails. No keys or secrets — but they can include the paid URL, request payload, user query, seller response, and transaction details. Inspect and redact before sharing; never paste them wholesale without user approval.

For full flag lists and JSON output shapes, run `<cmd> --help` — these change as the CLI evolves and are authoritative there, not here.
