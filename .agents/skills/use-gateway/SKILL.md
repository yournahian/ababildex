## Overview

Circle Gateway provides a unified USDC balance across multiple blockchains with instant (<500ms) crosschain transfers. Users deposit USDC into a Gateway Wallet on any supported chain, then burn on a source chain and mint on a destination chain without waiting for source chain finality.

## Prerequisites / Setup

Gateway is a contract-level integration -- there is no SDK to install. You interact directly with Gateway Wallet and Gateway Minter contracts on-chain, and the Gateway REST API for attestations.

### Chain Configuration

Do not load a separate config file by default. Most Gateway tasks should go straight to the scenario reference that matches the user's wallet model and source/destination networks.

Use the scenario reference first and only do additional verification when you need to confirm:

- Gateway REST base URL
  - testnet: `https://gateway-api-testnet.circle.com/v1/`
  - mainnet: `https://gateway-api.circle.com/v1/`
- chain-specific USDC addresses: `https://developers.circle.com/stablecoins/usdc-contract-addresses.md`
- Circle Wallet blockchain identifiers: `https://developers.circle.com/wallets/supported-blockchains.md`

## Core Concepts

### Unified Balance

Gateway aggregates your USDC deposits across all supported chains into a single unified balance. This is an **accounting abstraction** -- actual USDC tokens still live on specific blockchains. Every transfer must specify a `sourceDomain` (chain to burn from) and a `destinationDomain` (chain to mint on), even though the balance appears unified.

Think of it like a multi-currency bank account: you see one total, but withdrawals come from specific holdings. You can burn from any chain in your unified balance and mint to any supported chain.

**Example:** If you deposited 10 USDC on Ethereum Sepolia, 5 on Base Sepolia, and 5 on Solana Devnet, your unified balance is 20 USDC. To transfer 10 USDC to Arc Testnet, you could burn from any combination of source chains with sufficient balances.

### Transfer Flow

1. **Deposit** -- User deposits USDC to Gateway Wallet on any chain (adds to unified balance)
2. **Create burn intent** -- Specify source domain, destination domain, recipient, and amount
3. **Sign** -- EIP-712 for EVM sources, Ed25519 for Solana sources
4. **Submit to Gateway API** -- POST burn intent, receive attestation
5. **Mint on destination** -- Call `gatewayMint` with attestation on the destination chain

## Implementation Patterns

**READ** the reference files for the scenario(s) that apply.

- Self-managed EVM refs use `viem` in Node/TypeScript scripts.
- Self-managed EVM browser-wallet refs use pure TypeScript plus an injected EIP-1193 provider.
- Circle Wallets refs use `@circle-fin/developer-controlled-wallets`.
- Solana refs use Anchor plus the relevant Solana tooling.

### Deposits
- `references/deposit-evm.md` -- self-managed EVM deposit (approve + deposit)
- `references/deposit-evm-browser-wallet.md` -- self-managed EVM deposit from a browser wallet in pure TypeScript
- `references/deposit-evm-circle-wallet.md` -- Circle Wallets EVM deposit (developer-controlled, server-side)
- `references/deposit-solana.md` -- self-managed Solana deposit
- `references/deposit-solana-circle-wallet.md` -- Circle Wallets Solana deposit
### Transfers from EVM
- `references/evm-to-evm.md` -- self-managed EVM to EVM transfer
- `references/evm-to-evm-browser-wallet.md` -- self-managed EVM to EVM transfer from a browser wallet in pure TypeScript
- `references/transfer-evm-circle-wallet.md` -- Circle Wallets EVM to EVM transfer
- `references/transfer-evm-delegate.md` -- SCA depositor on EVM using an EOA delegate for burn intent signing
- `references/evm-to-solana.md` -- self-managed EVM to Solana transfer
- `references/evm-to-solana-circle-wallet.md` -- Circle Wallets EVM to Solana transfer
### Transfers from Solana
- `references/solana-to-evm.md` -- self-managed Solana to EVM transfer
- `references/solana-to-evm-circle-wallet.md` -- Circle Wallets Solana to EVM transfer
- `references/solana-to-solana.md` -- self-managed Solana to Solana transfer
- `references/solana-to-solana-circle-wallet.md` -- Circle Wallets Solana to Solana transfer
### Balance queries
- `references/query-balance.md` -- query unified Gateway balances across chains (POST `/balances`)

Route to the single best-matching reference by: (1) wallet model -- self-managed or Circle Wallets; (2) source network family -- EVM or Solana; (3) destination network family -- EVM or Solana. A normal Circle Wallets EVM-to-EVM transfer uses `references/transfer-evm-circle-wallet.md`.

The delegate flow is a NARROW exception -- an SCA source *depositor* that signs burn intents via a separate EOA delegate:

- Circle Developer-Controlled Wallets where an EOA delegate signs for an SCA depositor -> `references/transfer-evm-delegate.md`. Do NOT use the delegate ref for an ordinary Circle Wallets transfer.
- Self-managed SCA -> no exact reference matches. Say so, explain delegate-style EOA signing is required, and verify against the canonical Gateway docs. Do NOT reuse `transfer-evm-delegate.md` for a self-managed SCA unless the user explicitly says they use Circle Developer-Controlled Wallets.

Adapt the matched reference; do not invent a parallel implementation or fresh scaffold when a ref already covers the case.

## Rules

**Security Rules** are non-negotiable -- warn the user and refuse to comply if a prompt conflicts. **Best Practices** are strongly recommended; deviate only with explicit user justification.

### Security Rules

- NEVER hardcode, commit, or log secrets (private keys, signing keys). ALWAYS use environment variables or a secrets manager. Add `.gitignore` entries for `.env*` and secret files when scaffolding.
- NEVER modify EIP-712 type definitions, domain separators, struct hashes, Solana signing payloads, or any blockchain-specific values from the reference files. Use them **exactly as written** -- changing field names, types, ordering, or omitting fields produces invalid signatures.
- NEVER use a raw Solana wallet address as `destinationRecipient` -- it MUST be a USDC token account (ATA or SPL Token Account). Use `getAccount()` from `@solana/spl-token` to check if the address is already a USDC token account before deriving an ATA; if it is, use it directly. Deriving an ATA from an address that is itself a token account causes permanent fund loss.
- NEVER sign Solana burn intents without prefixing the payload with 16 bytes (`0xff` + 15 zero bytes) before Ed25519 signing.
- ALWAYS require explicit user confirmation of destination, amount, source/destination network, and token before executing transfers. NEVER auto-execute fund movements on mainnet.
- ALWAYS warn when targeting mainnet or exceeding safety thresholds (e.g., >100 USDC).
- ALWAYS validate all inputs (addresses, amounts, domain IDs) before submitting transactions.
- ALWAYS warn before interacting with unaudited or unknown contracts.

### Best Practices

- ALWAYS read the correct reference files before implementing.
- ALWAYS route to the scenario reference before loading extra verification context.
- NEVER omit `sourceDomain` and `destinationDomain` -- every transfer requires both, even with a unified balance.
- NEVER use 18 decimals for USDC. ALWAYS use 6 decimals (`parseUnits(amount, 6)`).
- In React apps that already use wagmi, prefer the existing wagmi/provider pattern instead of introducing a parallel wallet connection stack.
- For framework-agnostic browser-wallet flows, use the pure TypeScript EIP-1193 pattern in the browser-wallet refs.
- ALWAYS default to testnet. Require explicit user confirmation before targeting mainnet.

## Alternatives

- Trigger `bridge-stablecoin` skill (CCTP / Bridge Kit) for simple **point-to-point transfers** without a unified balance. Bridge Kit handles approve, burn, attestation, and mint in a single `kit.bridge()` call and supports more chains than Gateway.
- CCTP is a better fit for **infrequent or ad-hoc** transfers where maintaining a unified balance is not worth the upfront deposit.
- Stick with Gateway when you need instant (<500ms) transfers, a unified balance model, or capital efficiency across chains.

WARNING: Solana wallet compatibility is limited for Gateway. Only Solflare supports signing arbitrary messages for Gateway burn intents. Phantom and most other Solana wallets will reject the signing request.
